# Changes in this fork

Most changes in the folder ./startup.
If you want to use the startup settings I suggest you fork this repo, make your changes, then run this command:
`cp ./startup/boot.cmd shell:startup`

This will make everything in the startup folder be used at startup.

## Todo

- Zsh + autosuggestions in wsl
- some kind of sync/deployment of files in this repo to my hosts?
- personal aliases for WSL
- Window/tile manager
- better sync, YADM?
- sync settings to remote servers

Done:

- Personal settings and preferences

- WIP: keybinds.ahk - Global keybinds to stop bad habits, increase productivity
- global powershell profile for productivity 
- windows terminal settings sync
- "autoupdates" via startup script
- bash-like aliases in powershell
